# CombineGRPC

CombineGRPC is a library that provides [Combine framework](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine) integration for [Swift gRPC](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-swift).

CombineGRPC provides two flavours of functionality, `call` and `handle`. Use `call` to make gRPC calls on the client side, and `handle` to handle incoming requests on the server side. The library provides versions of `call` and `handle` for all RPC styles. Here are the input and output types for each.

RPC Style | Input and Output Types
--- | ---
Unary | `Request -> AnyPublisher<Response, RPCError>`
Server streaming | `Request -> AnyPublisher<Response, RPCError>`
Client streaming | `AnyPublisher<Request, Error> -> AnyPublisher<Response, RPCError>`
Bidirectional streaming | `AnyPublisher<Request, Error> -> AnyPublisher<Response, RPCError>`

When you make a unary call, you provide a request message, and get back a response publisher. The response publisher will either publish a single response, or fail with an `RPCError` error. Similarly, if you are handling a unary RPC call, you provide a handler that takes a request parameter and returns an `AnyPublisher<Response, RPCError>`.

You can follow the same intuition to understand the types for the other RPC styles. The only difference is that publishers for the streaming RPCs may publish zero or more messages instead of the single response message that is expected from the unary response publisher.

## Quick Tour

Let's see a quick example. Consider the following protobuf definition for a simple echo service. The service defines one bidirectional RPC. You send it a stream of messages and it echoes the messages back to you.

```protobuf
syntax = "proto3";

service EchoService {
  rpc SayItBack (stream EchoRequest) returns (stream EchoResponse);
}

message EchoRequest {
  string message = 1;
}

message EchoResponse {
  string message = 1;
}
```

### Server Side

To implement the server, you provide a handler function that takes an input stream `AnyPublisher<EchoRequest, Error>` and returns an output stream `AnyPublisher<EchoResponse, RPCError>`.

```swift
import Foundation
import Combine
import CombineGRPC
import GRPC
import NIO

class EchoServiceProvider: EchoProvider {
  
  // Simple bidirectional RPC that echoes back each request message
  func sayItBack(context: StreamingResponseCallContext<EchoResponse>) -> EventLoopFuture<(StreamEvent<EchoRequest>) -> Void> {
    CombineGRPC.handle(context) { requests in
      requests
        .map { req in
          EchoResponse.with { $0.message = req.message }
        }
        .setFailureType(to: RPCError.self)
        .eraseToAnyPublisher()
    }
  }
}
```

Start the server. This is the same process as with Swift gRPC.

```swift
let eventLoopGroup = MultiThreadedEventLoopGroup(numberOfThreads: 1)
defer {
  try! eventLoopGroup.syncShutdownGracefully()
}

// Start the gRPC server and wait until it shuts down.
_ = try Server
  .insecure(group: eventLoopGroup)
  .withServiceProviders([EchoServiceProvider()])
  .bind(host: "localhost", port: 8080)
  .flatMap { $0.onClose }
  .wait()
```

### Client Side

Now let's setup our client. Again, it's the same process that you would go through when using Swift gRPC.

```swift
let eventLoopGroup = MultiThreadedEventLoopGroup(numberOfThreads: 1)
let channel = ClientConnection
  .insecure(group: eventLoopGroup)
  .connect(host: "localhost", port: 8080)
let echoClient = EchoServiceClient(channel: channel)
```

To call the service, create a `GRPCExecutor` and use its `call` method. You provide it with a stream of requests `AnyPublisher<EchoRequest, Error>` and you get back a stream `AnyPublisher<EchoResponse, RPCError>` of responses from the server.

```swift
let requests = repeatElement(EchoRequest.with { $0.message = "hello"}, count: 10)
let requestStream: AnyPublisher<EchoRequest, Error> =
  Publishers.Sequence(sequence: requests).eraseToAnyPublisher()
let grpc = GRPCExecutor()

grpc.call(echoClient.sayItBack)(requestStream)
  .filter { $0.message == "hello" }
  .count()
  .sink(receiveValue: { count in
    assert(count == 10)
  })
```

That's it! You have set up bidirectional streaming between a server and client. The method `sayItBack` of `EchoServiceClient` is generated by Swift gRPC. Notice that call is curried. You can preselect RPC calls using partial application:

```swift
let sayItBack = grpc.call(echoClient.sayItBack)

sayItBack(requestStream).map { response in
  // ...
}
```

### Configuring RPC Calls

The `GRPCExecutor` allows you to configure `CallOptions` for your RPC calls. You can provide the `GRPCExecutor`'s initializer with a stream `AnyPublisher<CallOptions, Never>`, and the latest `CallOptions` value will be used when making calls. 

```swift
let timeoutOptions = CallOptions(timeout: try! .seconds(5))
let grpc = GRPCExecutor(callOptions: Just(timeoutOptions).eraseToAnyPublisher())
```

### Retry Policy

You can also configure `GRPCExecutor` to automatically retry failed calls by specifying a `RetryPolicy`. In the following example, we retry calls that fail with status  `.unauthenticated`. We use `CallOptions` to add a Bearer token to the authorization header, and then retry the call.

```swift
// Default CallOptions with no authentication
let callOptions = CurrentValueSubject<CallOptions, Never>(CallOptions())

let grpc = GRPCExecutor(
  callOptions: callOptions.eraseToAnyPublisher(),
  retry: .failedCall(
    upTo: 1,
    when: { error in
      error.status.code == .unauthenticated
    },
    delayUntilNext: { retryCount, error in  // Useful for implementing exponential backoff
      // Retry the call with authentication
      callOptions.send(CallOptions(customMetadata: HTTPHeaders([("authorization", "Bearer xxx")])))
      return Just(()).eraseToAnyPublisher()
    },
    didGiveUp: {
      print("Authenticated call failed.")
    }
  )
)

grpc.call(client.authenticatedRpc)(request)
  .map { response in
    // ...
  }
```

You can imagine doing something along those lines to seamlessly retry calls when an ID token expires. The back-end service replies with status `.unauthenticated`, you obtain a new ID token using your refresh token, and the call is retried.

## Logistics

### Generating Swift Code from Protobuf

To generate Swift code from your .proto files, you'll need to first install the [protoc](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf) Protocol Buffer compiler.

```text
brew install protobuf
```

Next, download the [swift and grpc-swift protoc plugins](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-swift/releases/download/1.5.0/protoc-grpc-swift-plugins-1.5.0.zip). Unarchive the downloaded file and move the binaries from the `bin/` directory to somewhere in your `$PATH`.

Now you are ready to generate Swift code from protobuf interface definition files.

Let's generate the message types, gRPC server and gRPC client for Swift.

```text
protoc example_service.proto --swift_out=Generated/
protoc example_service.proto --grpc-swift_out=Generated/
```

You'll see that protoc has created two source files for us.

```text
ls Generated/
example_service.grpc.swift
example_service.pb.swift
```

### Adding CombineGRPC to Your Project

You can easily add CombineGRPC to your project using either Swift Package Manager or CocoaPods.

#### Swift Package Manager

Add the package dependency to your `Package.swift`:

```swift
dependencies: [
  .package(url: "https://github.com/vyshane/grpc-swift-combine.git", from: "1.0.7"),
],
```

#### CocoaPods

Add the following line to your `Podfile`:

```text
pod 'CombineGRPC', '~> 1.0.7'
```
